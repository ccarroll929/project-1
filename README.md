# DailyGrind Wellness Tracker

###  Project Description: 
This web application is designed to help wellness-oriented users to find exercises by searching for a muscle or muscle group and also keep track of their daily calorie intake with a calorie calculator. It utilizes two server-side API databases, API Ninjas and Calorie Ninjas, to provide users with the data for exercises and calorie intake.
