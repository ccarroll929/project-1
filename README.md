# Daily Grind Wellness Tracker

###  Project Description: 
This web application allows users to track their calories and calculate their daily average caloric intake. It utilizes two server-side APIs, Calorie Ninjas and API Ninja, to take types and amounts of food entered by the user and calculate the number of calories it has. The daily average caloric intake can then be calculated and displayed on a graph.
